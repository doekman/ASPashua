ASPashua
========

This AppleScript Library tries to make it convenient to use [Pashua][] with AppleScript for enhanced dialogs.

Getting started
---------------

Download the [latest release][latest-release], and install it in one of the _Script Libraries_ folders (more more instructions in the download). 

In the download you will also find examples of how to use the script library.

When you are done playing with those, you can see the [Pashua documentation][pashua-config] on what you can do with these forms.

There are two distributions: in the biggest archive, the Pashua application is embedded within the script library, so you don't need to distribute it.


Developing
----------

Pre-requisites for working with this repository:

* you need to have [osagitfilter][] installed, before cloning this repository.
* you need to have [Pashua][] installed on your system, since this library is a wrapper for that application.
* it's handy to have [ok-bash][] installed, so you can easy use the included `.ok`-file.

Type `make` to see the help-screen. And type `ok` (or `cat .ok`) for some additional commands.
